<h1><a class="anchor" id="BasicUsage"></a>
Basic job system usage</h1>
<h2><a class="anchor" id="Setup"></a>
Setup</h2>
<p>Before using jobs, a <a class="el" href="class_a_z_1_1_job_manager.html">JobManager</a> instance must be created. This is responsible for scheduling and running the jobs. Multiple JobManagers are supported, but in most cases a single <a class="el" href="class_a_z_1_1_job_manager.html">JobManager</a> will suffice.</p>
<p>When creating a <a class="el" href="class_a_z_1_1_job_manager.html">JobManager</a>, the <a class="el" href="struct_a_z_1_1_job_manager_desc.html">JobManagerDesc</a> is used to specify the worker threads to create with the <a class="el" href="class_a_z_1_1_job_manager.html">JobManager</a>. The details of this depend on the platform. For single-core platforms, i.e. Wii, no worker threads are allowed (job processing will be synchronous on these platforms, and is only provided in order to simplify user code). On PC multiple worker threads are supported, on some platforms the core for each worker thread can also be specified.</p>
<p>Optionally the global job context can also be specified, with <a class="el" href="class_a_z_1_1_job_context.html#a8833c6646b2b65c3fa4a09856a1848b9">JobContext::SetGlobalContext()</a>. This is the execution context that will be used for jobs when a context is not explicitly specified. If you have only one <a class="el" href="class_a_z_1_1_job_manager.html">JobManager</a> in your application then it can be convenient to set the global context.</p>
<h2><a class="anchor" id="Creating"></a>
Creating jobs</h2>
<p>Multiple job types are supported, with different methods of specifying their payloads. All jobs take two standard parameters, isAutoDelete, explained below, and the <a class="el" href="class_a_z_1_1_job_context.html">JobContext</a> to use for executing the job. If the context is NULL then the global context will be used to find the parent context.</p>
<ul>
<li><b><a class="el" href="class_a_z_1_1_job_function.html">JobFunction</a></b> - This uses <a class="el" href="class_a_z_std_1_1function.html">AZStd::function</a> to allow any callable object to be used as the payload. </li>
<li><b>JobDelegate</b> - Similar to <a class="el" href="class_a_z_1_1_job_function.html">JobFunction</a>, but uses <a class="el" href="class_a_z_std_1_1delegate.html">AZStd::delegate</a>, can be slightly more efficient sometimes. </li>
<li><b>JobUser</b> - This provides a base class from which the user may derive to implement the payload.</li>
</ul>
<h2><a class="anchor" id="AutoDelete"></a>
Auto-deletion of jobs</h2>
<p>Allowing auto-deletion for jobs is the recommended behavior, as it simplifies their usage considerably. An auto-deletion job must have been allocated using aznew. Jobs use an efficient <a class="el" href="class_a_z_1_1_thread_pool_allocator.html">ThreadPoolAllocator</a> as their default allocator, so allocation is efficient, and does not require any synchronization.</p>
<p>If you choose to not use auto-deletion, then the jobs must be manually reset with <a class="el" href="class_a_z_1_1_job.html#a0d4252880941cbc302d4206508d56a61">Job::Reset</a> before they can be re-used. Also any job dependencies which were setup must be set again. Care must also be taken when deleting the job, to ensure it is not being used by the <a class="el" href="class_a_z_1_1_job_manager.html">JobManager</a>.</p>
<h2><a class="anchor" id="Starting"></a>
Starting jobs</h2>
<p>A job is started and released for execution by calling <a class="el" href="class_a_z_1_1_job.html#af343b17c0d074f4d0b8cb309e379b279">Job::Start()</a>. After the job has been started, it is forbidden to access or use the job in any way! This is because once started, the job may be being processed and even deleted before your attempt to access it. Jobs may be started by any thread, including from inside another a worker thread (this is actually the most efficient way to spawn a job!)</p>
<h2><a class="anchor" id="Waiting"></a>
Waiting for jobs</h2>
<p>After a user (non-worker) thread has started some jobs, it often wants to block until the jobs have finished. The only safe way to do this is by using a <a class="el" href="class_a_z_1_1_job_completion.html">JobCompletion</a> job. The <a class="el" href="class_a_z_1_1_job_completion.html">JobCompletion</a> job should be set as the final dependent in the series of jobs, and then the user thread can block by calling <a class="el" href="class_a_z_1_1_job_completion.html#adf253790eeeacf9a7f742acfd554212b">JobCompletion::StartAndWaitForCompletion()</a>.</p>
<p>It is also possible for a currently processing job to suspend itself until its child jobs have completed. The child jobs must be started by the parent job by calling <a class="el" href="class_a_z_1_1_job.html#a782108e6d95080cc554c32a5a93f1643">Job::StartAsChild()</a>, and then the parent can suspend until they are complete by calling <a class="el" href="class_a_z_1_1_job.html#a97d0390d75540622424ae42b601f7cd4">Job::WaitForChildren()</a>. Note that there is a limit to the depth which jobs may be nested, the stack space can be exhausted quite quickly if there is a lot of nesting. There is also a very slight performance penalty to using child jobs, as the parent job can only resume on the same thread from which it was started. If either of these issues are a concern, explicit dependencies and join jobs can be used instead, see <a class="el" href="_job_system.html#Techniques">Job design techniques</a>.</p>
<p>Finally, it is possible for a user thread to assist in job processing while waiting for a job to complete, by calling <a class="el" href="class_a_z_1_1_job.html#ae0ba290be0c50b1a8407d0a6fc130442">Job::StartAndAssistUntilComplete()</a>. This is not usually recommended however, it is better for the user thread to perform other unrelated processing, or for more processing to be moved into the job system. Also, if a worker thread is available on the same core as the user thread, then there is no penalty to just blocking execution with a <a class="el" href="class_a_z_1_1_job_completion.html">JobCompletion</a>.</p>
<h1><a class="anchor" id="DesigningGoodJobs"></a>
Designing good jobs</h1>
<h2><a class="anchor" id="JobSize"></a>
Job size</h2>
<p>The job system is designed for fine-grained job processing. The amount of overhead for each job is kept to a minimum, often the next job can be popped from the queue with no synchronization at all, and the call to the payload processing is just a single virtual function call or function pointer call.</p>
<p>So jobs should be kept quite small in general. The advantage to small jobs is that they will utilize all the available cores more efficiently, and can scale easily to larger numbers of cores. A big job can end up blocking other cores which are waiting for it to complete, the other cores may even just run out of work, and then all cores end up waiting for the single remaining job to complete.</p>
<h2><a class="anchor" id="Synchronization"></a>
Synchronization</h2>
<p>Synchronization between threads should be avoided as much as possible in job processing functions. It is often surprising just how much a single point of synchronization between jobs can impact performance. The fork/join processing model is a good way to avoid synchronization. The parallel containers in <a class="el" href="namespace_a_z_std.html" title="AZ namespace needs to be closed in order to specialize the AZStd::hash struct for AddressTypeElement ...">AZStd</a> can also be an option.</p>
<p>A common synchronization point, which is often overlooked, is memory allocation. If you must allocate memory from inside a job, consider using one of the thread-local allocators which will not synchronize, e.g. <a class="el" href="class_a_z_1_1_thread_pool_allocator.html">ThreadPoolAllocator</a>.</p>
<h1><a class="anchor" id="Techniques"></a>
Job design techniques</h1>
<p><a class="el" href="class_a_z_1_1_job.html">Job</a> structure will usually be based on the fork/join model. Jobs will spawn other jobs, i.e. forking, and eventually they will coalesce back, i.e. joining. There are several techniques available in the job system to implement this.</p>
<h2><a class="anchor" id="TaskGroup"></a>
Using task_groups</h2>
<p>This is the highest level interface available in the job system. It is a pseudo-standard interface, similar to the interface available in both Visual Studio 2010 and the latest versions of Intel's Threading Building Blocks.</p>
<p>It is very simple to use, just create a <a class="el" href="class_a_z_1_1structured__task__group.html">structured_task_group</a>, then fork processing to any function by calling <a class="el" href="class_a_z_1_1structured__task__group.html#afef8404f22ec22163145e4d80c0c1a31">structured_task_group::run()</a> as many times as desired, and then block until all processing is complete by calling <a class="el" href="class_a_z_1_1structured__task__group.html#acc90d3bfbcc685097f4a2527269b8c06">structured_task_group::wait()</a>. The usage is identical whether it is used on a user thread or a worker thread.</p>
<p>The internal implementation is using child jobs, so it has the same limitations as child jobs, described below.</p>
<h2><a class="anchor" id="ChildJobs"></a>
Using child jobs</h2>
<p>Child jobs allow the parent to suspend execution until the child jobs are complete. This allows the 'join' logic to be placed in the same function, without needing to implement a separate 'join' job.</p>
<p>Child jobs must be started using <a class="el" href="class_a_z_1_1_job.html#a782108e6d95080cc554c32a5a93f1643">Job::StartAsChild()</a> from within the parent job. The parent job may then suspend until all its children are complete by calling <a class="el" href="class_a_z_1_1_job.html#a97d0390d75540622424ae42b601f7cd4">Job::WaitForChildren()</a>.</p>
<p>Note that there are some issues to be aware of when using child jobs. There is a limit to the depth which jobs may be nested, as the available stack memory can be exhausted quite quickly if there is a lot of nesting. There is also a very slight performance penalty to using child jobs, as the parent job can only resume on the same thread from which it was started. If either of these issues are a concern, explicit dependencies and join jobs can be used instead as described in the next section.</p>
<h2><a class="anchor" id="ExplicitDependencies"></a>
Using explicit dependencies with continuations</h2>
<p><a class="el" href="class_a_z_1_1_job.html">Job</a> dependencies can also be managed explicitly. This is the lowest-level and also the most efficient interface available in the job system.</p>
<p>A dependency can be set by calling <a class="el" href="class_a_z_1_1_job.html#a10e6f61953b8bd63493f8dc3f8c2ebd4">Job::SetDependent()</a>. A dependent job will not run until all of the jobs which have specified it as a dependent have completed. Dependencies can only be set before both the jobs have started.</p>
<p>A job can have only one dependent, but multiple jobs can specify the same job as their dependent. This is usually sufficient as dependencies are usually used to implement the 'join' part of the fork/join model. The fork part can be easily implemented by just spawning the forked jobs directly, dependencies are not necessary. If it is absolutely necessary to have a many-to-many dependency relationship, then JobMultipleDependent can be used, please consider re-organizing your job structure instead before using this though.</p>
<h2><a class="anchor" id="Continuations"></a>
Continuations</h2>
<p>After a job has spawned its forked jobs and join job, its execution is finished. But this often leads to a problem, as whoever spawned the current job may have specified a dependent to run after the current job is complete. But the current job will not conceptually be complete until the join job has finished. The <a class="el" href="class_a_z_1_1_job.html#a7d08a56253e249c7f9d45b629929c65d">Job::SetContinuation</a> function allows the current job to specify that the join job is a 'continuation' of the current job, and any dependency of the current job should not actually be ran until the join job is complete also.</p>
