UI components define the properties of a UI element. For example, every element has a **Transform2D** component that defines its position, rotation, size, and scale. You can give an element additional properties by adding components, such as adding the **Image** component to give an element color or texture. Each UI element can have one visual component (**Image** or **Text**), one interactive component (**Button**, **Check Box**, **Scroll Box**, **Slider**, or **Text Input**), and one layout component (**Layout Column**, **Layout Row**, or **Layout Grid**). You can attach any or all of the remaining components: **Dynamic** components, **Tooltips**, **Tooltips Display**, **Mask**, and **Fader**.
