Each UI element's position is determined by the Transform2D component. The Transform2D component sets a UI element's position and size relative to its parent's edges. The parent may be another element (if the elements are nested), or the canvas.

For more information about the Transform2D component, see [Managing UI Anchors and Offsets](../components/transform2d).
