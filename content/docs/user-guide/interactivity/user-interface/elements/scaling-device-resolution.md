You can use the **Scale to Device** property on the **Transform2D** component with the anchoring system to build UIs that display on multiple screen resolutions. The **Scale to Device** property applies an element scale that's based on the ratio of the authored canvas size to the target canvas size.

To view the effects of this computation, open the **Preview** canvas in the UI Editor.

For more information about the **Transform2D** component's **Scale to Device** property, see [Scale to Device](../components/transform2d).
