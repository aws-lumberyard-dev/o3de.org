The **Terrain Surface Materials List** component defines mappings between surface types and render materials.  You can use this to change the appearance of a surface type within different areas of your game. When you assign a material to a surface type, all the visible surfaces of that type, within the bounds of the required [Axis Aligned Box Shape](/docs/user-guide/components/reference/shape/axis-aligned-box-shape/) component, will adopt that material.


## Usage
Select the surface type tag using the **SurfaceTag** drop-down menu, then assign a material by clicking {{< icon "file-folder.svg" >}} and choosing a material, or by dragging a material from the AssetBrowser window.

## Provider

[Terrain Gem](/docs/user-guide/gems/reference/environment/terrain)

## TerrainAreaMaterialRequestBus

Use the following request functions with the `TerrainAreaMaterialRequestBus` EBus interface to communicate with Surface Material List components of your game.


| Request Name | Description | Parameter | Return | Scriptable |
|-|-|-|-|-|
| `GetSurfaceMaterialMappings` | Retrieves all the assigned surface types, the materials that you have assigned to them, and the bounds that are set for this entity.  | None | Terrain Surface Material Mapping: Vector | No. |


## TerrainAreaMaterialNotificationBus

| Notification Name | Description | Parameter | Return | Scriptable |
|-|-|-|-|-|
| `OnTerrainSurfaceMaterialMappingCreated` | Notifies listeners when a new mapping between a Surface and a Material is set up. | None | EntityId; Surface Tag; Material | No |
| `OnTerrainSurfaceMaterialMappingDestroyed` | Notifies listeners when a mapping between a Surface and a Material is removed. | None | EntityId; Surface Tag | No |
| `OnTerrainSurfaceMaterialMappingChanged` | Notifies listeners when a mapping between a Surface and a Material is changed. | None | EntityId; Surface Tag; Material | No |
| `OnTerrainSurfaceMaterialMappingRegionChanged` | Notifies listeners when the bounds of the component are modified. | None | EntityId; Old Region: Aabb; New Region: Aabb | No |
