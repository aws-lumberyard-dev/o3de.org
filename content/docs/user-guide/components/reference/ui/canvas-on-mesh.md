description: Use the UI Canvas on Mesh component to place a UI canvas on a component entity in the 3D world that a user can interact with in Open 3D Engine (O3DE).
---

With the **UI Canvas on Mesh** component, you can place a UI canvas on a component entity in the 3D world that a user can interact with using a cursor.

## Usage

You can use the **Render target override** property when you want to load two unique instances of the same UI canvas that the user can set to different states. Assigning this property to an `.attimage` Attachment Image asset overrides a UI canvas' [**Render Target** property](/docs/user-guide/interactivity/user-interface/canvases/canvas-properties/#rendering-properties) value. You must use the same Attachment Image asset selected in **Render target override** as the diffuse texture of the mesh or actor's material.

For simple cases that do not require unique instances of the same `.uicanvas` asset, you can leave the **Render target override** property blank.
