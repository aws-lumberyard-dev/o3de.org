1. In the Entity Outliner, you can create, select, search, and filter for entities.

   You can select multiple entities by doing one of the following in the **Entity Outliner**:

- Use **Ctrl + Left Mouse Button** to select multiple entities one at a time to be part of a multi-selection.
- Use **Shift + Left Mouse Button** to select a range of entities.

## Reordering Entities

When you create entities or instantiate prefabs, they appear at the bottom of the list in the **Entity Outliner**.

1. To move an entity, right-click an entity and choose **Move up** or **Move down**.

## Hiding and Showing Entities

You can hide entities so that they don't appear in the viewport, so that the viewport shows only the entities that you want. If you hide a parent entity, all children entities are also hidden. You can also hide child entities within a parent entity.

1. In the **Entity Outliner**, click the eye icon next to the entity. The crossed-out eye icon indicates that the entity doesn't appear in the viewport.

1. To show the entity, click the icon again.

## Locking Entities 

You can lock entities so that they can't be selected in the viewport, so that you can select only the entities that you want to edit. If you lock a parent entity, all children entities are also locked. You can also lock child entities within a parent entity.

1. In the **Entity Outliner**, click the lock icon next to the entity. The icon appears white when the entity is locked.

1. To unlock the entity, click the lock icon again.

## Search and Filter for Entities

For levels that have many entities, you can search and filter for the entities that you want. Enter text in the search filter box to find specific entities.

**To search for an entity by *name***

1. In the **Entity Outliner**, enter the name for the entity.

1. To filter by component, click the filter icon.

1. Enter component names in the search field that appears or scroll and select the entities that you want. Any entity that has the specified component appears in the results.
**Example**

     The entities that appear have either the **Camera** or the **Trigger Area** components attached.

**To search for an entity by *ID***

    You can also sort entities so that they appear in the order that you want in the **Entity Outliner**.

**To sort entities**

1. In the **Entity Outliner**, click the sort icon.

     ![Sort entities in the Entity Outliner.](/images/shared/shared-entity-outliner-sort-filter.png)

1. Choose the following options:

     - **Sort: Manually** - Manually organize entities.
     - **Sort: A to Z**- Sort entities alphabetically, in ascending order.
     - **Sort: Z to A** - Sort entities, in descending order.
     - **Scroll to Selected** - When you select an entity in the viewport, the **Entity Outliner** scrolls to that entity. If you select multiple entities, the **Entity Outliner** scrolls to the last selected entity.
     - **Expand Selected** - When you select an entity in the viewport, the **Entity Outliner** expands the hierarchy to show any child entities.

     You can also select an entity in the **Entity Outliner** to find it in the viewport or in reverse. This feature helps you find the entities that you want, especially in large levels.

**To locate an entity or prefab**

1. In the **Entity Outliner**, right-click an entity and choose **Find in viewport**. The viewport navigates to the corresponding entity.
