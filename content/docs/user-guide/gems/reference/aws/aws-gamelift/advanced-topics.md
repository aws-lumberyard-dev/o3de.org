This topic covers some advanced ways to use the **AWS GameLift** Gem.


## Use resource mapping files to look up fleets

A *GameLift fleet* is a set of Amazon EC2 virtual machines, called *instances*, that represents your hosting resources. A *fleet ID* is a unique identifier for each fleet, which Amazon GameLift generates.

In most cases, your game will use more than one fleet. To avoid using a fixed fleet ID in your script, you can use a resource mapping file, which lets you look up fleet IDs at runtime. Using a resource mapping file helps keep your code or script clean and consistent. For more information, refer to [Resource Mapping Files](/docs/user-guide/gems/reference/aws/aws-core/resource-mapping-files/).

The following examples use [Script Canvas](/docs/user-guide/scripting/script-canvas/), but you can also search and join sessions using the [AWS GameLift Gem C++ API](/docs/api/gems/awsgamelift/).


### Example: Create a game session with 1 max player on 1 fleet

This example script shows you how to look up a fleet from a resource mapping file. Then, with the fleet, you create a session that allows one maximum player. (You can also do this example using the AWS GameLift Gem C++ API.)

In Script Canvas, follow these steps:

1. Create a variable with the `AWSGameLiftCreateSessionRequest` type and name it `request`.

2. Get the `request`'s object by using the variable's getter node.

3. Look up the fleet with the resource key `MyGameLiftFleetId` by using the **GetResourceNameId** node.

4. Set the `FleetId` of the `request`'s object by using the **FleetId** setter node.

5. Set the max number of players for the `request`'s object by using the **MaxPlayer** setter node.

6. Create a game session by using the **CreateSessionAsync** node.

### Example: Search game sessions across multiple fleets

This example script shows you how to search for active game sessions across multiple fleets by using a resource mapping file. If you have multiple fleets, you can store the fleet IDs in an array. Then, you can iterate through each fleet and search for active game sessions in the corresponding fleet. (You can also do this example using the AWS GameLift Gem C++ API.)

In Script Canvas, follow these steps:

1. Iterate through an array of `FleetId`s by using the **Get fleetId Keys** and **For Each** nodes.

2. For each fleet ID:  

   - Look up the fleet with the corresponding resource key by using the **GetResourceNameId** node.

   - Get the `request` object by using the variable's getter node.

   - Set the `FleetId` of the `request`'s object by using the **FleetId** setter node.

   - Search for an active and joinable session in the fleet by using the **SearchSessionsAsync** node.

## Search for and join sessions

The simplest method to search for sessions is by browsing through the server, which shows all of the available games. Then, the player can filter the games based on the type that they want to play, choose a game, and join a session.

The following examples use [Script Canvas](/docs/user-guide/scripting/script-canvas/), but you can also search and join sessions using the [AWS GameLift Gem C++ API](/docs/api/gems/awsgamelift/).


### Example: Search for sessions based on filter criteria

This example script shows you how to search for a maximum of 10 sessions in the corresponding fleet.

In Script Canvas, follow these steps:

1. Create a variable with the `AWSGameLiftSearchSessionRequest` type and name it `searchrequest`.

2. Get the `searchrequest`'s object by using the variable's getter node.

3. Look up the fleet with the resource key `MyGameLiftFleetId` by using the **GetResourceNameId** node.

4. Set the `FleetId` of the `searchrequest`'s object by using the **FleetId** setter node.

5. Filter the `searchrequest`'s object by a maximum number of sessions by using the **MaxResult** setter node.

7. Search for sessions by using the **SearchSessionsAsync** node.

### Example: Browse search results and join session

After you get search results from the previous example, this script chooses the first game session and joins it. The script begins automatically after **SearchSessionsAsync** completes with results.


1. Create a **AWSGameLiftSessionAsyncRequestNotificationBus** node. Then set this script to begin automatically after searching for sessions by adding the **OnSearchSessionsAsyncComplete** event. This returns a `SearchSessionsResponse` object.


2. Get an array of `SessionConfig`s from the `SearchSessionsResponse` object by using the **SessionConfigs** node.

3. Get the first `SessionConfig` object from the array by using the **Get First Element** node.

4. Set the `SessionId` of the `SessionConfig` object using the **SessionId** setter node.

5. Create a variable with the `AWSGameLiftJoinSessionRequest` type and name it `joinrequest`.

6. Set the session ID of the `joinrequest`'s object to the `SessionConfig`'s session ID by using the **SessionId** setter node.

7. Create a player ID for the session by using **CreatePlayerId** node.

8. Set the `PlayerId` of the `joinrequest`'s object by using the **PlayerId** setter node.

9.  Allow the player to join the session by using the **JoinSessionAsync** node.

## Get credentials from an Amazon Cognito identity pool

If your clients need to interact with AWS resources, you can use temporary AWS credentials that provide limited permissions to your resources. Your clients may need to interact with AWS resources to make requests against GameLift and to permit players to interact with your resources. With the [AWS Client Auth Gem](/docs/user-guide/gems/reference/aws/aws-client-auth/), you can use players' login information to get their AWS credentials from an Amazon Cognito identity pool.

To get players' credentials from an identity pool, they must successfully log in. After players log in, you can use the AWS GameLift Gem to configure the client and set up their AWS credentials by calling `AWSGameLiftClientManager::ConfigureGameLiftClient()`.


## Set up log paths for multiple server processes

You can configure GameLift fleets to run multiple processes on each instance. This can help you use your hosting resources more efficiently and potentially help reduce overall hosting costs. For more information, refer to [Managing how game servers are launched for hosting](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/gamelift/latest/developerguide/fleets-multiprocess.html) in the Amazon GameLift Developer Guide.

To support logging for multiple processes on the same GameLift instance, enter the following command. You can set a unique log path for a server process by providing a unique identifier in the `project-path` launch parameter. In this example, log files are saved to `C:\game\process1\user\log\` instead of the default log path.

```cmd
C:\game\bin\server.exe --engine-path=C:\game --project-path=C:\game\process1 --project-cache-path=C:\game\assets -bg_ConnectToAssetProcessor= 0
```
