**Open 3D Engine (O3DE)** ships with a **Multiplayer Gem** that uses the [O3DE networking stack](/docs/user-guide/networking/) to offer services used for multiplayer projects.

The Multiplayer Gem supports entity-based asynchronous networking in O3DE using event-driven network properties and remote procedure calls to synchronize O3DE components and entities across a network.

The Multiplayer Gem supports the following:

* Server authoritative networking model
* Player spawners
* Entity replication
* Push-based synchronization
* Event-driven network properties
* Reliable and unreliable remote procedure calls
* Local prediction
* Network input handlers

For information about working with the Multiplayer Gem, refer to [Multiplayer Framework](/docs/user-guide/networking/multiplayer/) in the Networking section.
