{{< note >}}
With version 22.05.0, the versioning release scheme changed. Binary installers now share a version with source, and the friendly name has been removed.

For earlier releases: Source versions use the `XXXX.Y` numbering model. Binary releases use `XX.XX FriendlyName` names, where the decimal place is moved to the left by two values from the original source code version.
