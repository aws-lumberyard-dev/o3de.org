This section provides a deeper technical read into the systems and interfaces underlying the **Atom Renderer**.

| Contents                        | Details |
|--------------------------------------|---------|
| [Frame Rendering](frame-rendering.md) | The frame rendering process describes how a scene is processed from Render Components, through Render Passes in the RPI, and to the RHI. |
| [Render Pipelines](render-pipelines.md) | An overview of Atom's pre-built render pipelines, and their supported features.  |
| [Material System](materials/_index.md) | The material system processes materials and material types and builds them into assets to use in the simulation. |
| [Shader System](shaders/_index.md) | The shader system processes shaders written in AZSL (Amazon Shading Language) and builds them into shader assets that can be used in your project. |
| [Render Pipeline Interface (RPI)](rpi/_index.md) | The Render Pipeline Interface (RPI) contains the main interface for developers to program the render pipeline. |
| [Passes](passes/_index.md) | The pass system transforms data from a scene into a final rendered output. |
| [Render Hardware Interface (RHI)](rhi/_index.md) | The Render Hardware Interface (RHI) provides a low-level interface that abstracts platform-specific code. |
| [Troubleshooting](troubleshoot.md) | A guide to troubleshoot graphics processing unit (GPU) crashes in Atom Renderer. |
