The tutorials in this section and the video below provide an introduction to project configuration and building in **Open 3D Engine (O3DE)** using the `o3de` command line interface (CLI) tool. The **O3DE CLI** is a Python script used for project configuration. Invoke it from the `scripts` directory in your O3DE install. For a complete guide to O3DE CLI commands, refer to the [Project Configuration CLI Reference](/docs/user-guide/project-config/cli-reference).

The instructions guide you through the following steps:

* Create a new O3DE project using the O3DE CLI.
* Generate project files for your IDE in your O3DE project directory.
* Build your O3DE project.

At the end of the tutorial, you'll have a new O3DE project based on the default "standard" project template.
